## Description

During the COVID pandemic, the schools and colleges were not open and the students were not
allowed to go to school .This had made it increasingly difficult for students to access labs and
understand the steps for doing an experiment.

In this project my team aimed to improve the remote lab learning experience which posed as a challenge during the COVID pandemic using **Virtual Reality** and **Animation**.

![Result](/vrresult.png)

We built a digital electronics lab in Blender and recorded the steps of performing the experiments using animation and exported the video as a 360 video with which one can get an immersive experience.
